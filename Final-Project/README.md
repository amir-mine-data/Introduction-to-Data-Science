# Introduction to Data Science Final Project

Final Project for DATS 6101: Introduction to Data Science by Prince Birring, Alicia Romero and Fei Teng

Data : https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/philadelphiacrimedata

## Goal

To understand the complexities of gathering data to answer a question that might not necessarily have data readily available, designing and validating a model and presenting model results effectively.
Instructions.<br/>

Come up with a question independent of data exploration.<br/>

Use the built-in tools to produce reports summarizing your findings in either RMarkdown or iPython Notebook.  Make sure your findings answer at least the following questions:<br/>
        
   1. How did you gather and prepare the data for analysis?<br/>
   2. How did you select and determine the correct model to answer your question?<br/>
   3. How reliable are your results?<br/>
   4. What additional information or analysis might improve your model results?<br/>

Develop a presentation that provides an overview of your results, inclusive of the limitations of your results and be prepared to demonstrate your knowledge in class.<br/>

## Deliverables

1. Please turn in your final copy of each of these items in Blackboard. <br/>
2. Outputs from either R and Python versions of report answering the questions detailed above.<br/>  
3. Your report should also include at least the following sections:<br/>
       * Abstract<br/>
       * Background research and question development<br/>
       * Relevant portions of code<br/>
       * Relevant output visualizations<br/>
       * References<br/>
4. Any slides or resources used for the presentation.<br/>

## Grading (See Rubric)

1. 25% Tool Selection/Demonstration of Coding with appropriate code explanations (#....)<br/>
2. 25% Goodness of Fit<br/>
3. 25% Model Selection<br/>
4. 25% Presentation<br/>
