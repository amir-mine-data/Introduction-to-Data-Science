# Introduction to Data Science Midterm Project

Midterm Project for DATS 6101:Introduction to Data Science by Prince Birring, Alicia Romero and Fei Teng.

## Goal
Better understand the initial stage of a data focused project by conducting background research and using R and Python to describe a dataset. 

## Instructions
Using a dataset from one of the built in packages, develop a research question using the steps discussed in class, including conducting background research. (Make sure to collect the references so you can cite your sources properly including learning how to cite a software package).  The question should be SMART and be either a descriptive or exploratory question. 
Use the built-in tools to produce two identical PDF reports summarizing your findings, one in RMarkdown and one in iPython Notebook.  Make sure your finding answer at least the following questions:

1.	What is the Number of Observations and Variables?
2.	What is the data measuring? 
3.	What are the Mean, Mode, Median of each of the variables included in the dataset?
4.	Visualizations that help tell the story of your data.<br/>

Develop a presentation that provides an overview/results and be prepared to demonstrate your knowledge in class.

## Deliverables
Please turn in your final copy of each of these items in Blackboard:<br/>
•	PDF outputs from both R and Python versions of report.  Your report should include at least the following sections:<br/>
  
   1.	Abstract<br/>
   2.	Background research and question development.<br/>
   3.	Tools used to answer the question.<br/>
   4.	Relevant portions of code.<br/>
   5.	Relevant output visualizations.<br/>
   6.	References<br/>
  
•	Original code files for the report in RMarkdown and .ipynb format.<br/>
•	Any slides or resources used for the presentation.<br/>
